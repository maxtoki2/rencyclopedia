# Extract metadata from files

Packages: `rtika`.

The example shows the extraction of metadata from a .mp3 file, but it works for a multitude of formats, including video, pdf, etc.

``` r
library(rtika)
library(jsonlite)
json <- tika_json("https://www.learningcontainer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kalimba.mp3")
fromJSON(json)
```
